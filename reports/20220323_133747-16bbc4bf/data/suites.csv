Bizarre Note (observations based on machines in the Melbourne

timezone)



Looks like this test starts to fail towards the end of the last

week of December, but starts passing again on 1 Jan.

Observed 2014/2015.



The same thing appears to happen with failures starting 1 Jul,

and passing resumes around 7 Jul.

Observed 2019.



This test looks like its tripping genuine bugs in Linux:

1. for glibc-2.2.4 or earlier, Linux seems to invert the sense of the

daylight savings ranges (- is valid output, + is broken linux version):



diff -c 600.out 600.out.bad:

check postgresql PMDA can reconnect when db bounces



Copyright (c) 2018 Red Hat.  All Rights Reserved.



Note: this test is _notrun if a local postgresql server is not installed

or not configured correctly and running. On Fedora (other platforms may

differ), install, initialize, enable and start the server :



sudo dnf install postgresql-server

sudo postgresql-setup initdb

sudo systemctl enable postgresql

sudo systemctl start postgresql



Also (on Fedora at least), after a major system upgrade may require you

to migrate an existing postgres DB to the new version. To do that:



sudo dnf install postgresql-upgrade

sudo postgresql-setup --upgrade

sudo systemctl restart postgresql



For Ubuntu, the major upgrade recipe is more like ...



remove the on install empty main cluster

sudo pg_dropcluster --stop <newversion> main

sudo systemctl stop postgresql

sudo pg_upgradecluster -m upgrade <oldversion> main

sudo systemctl start postgresql

check <oldversion> is down, <newversion> is online

pg_lsclusters

remove the <oldversion> cluster

sudo pg_dropcluster --stop <oldversion> main

Plan:

1. to show that the indom result for instance requests for

pmLookupInDom and pmNameInDom calls should NOT be different 

for DSOs versus daemon agents. 

2. to verify that opening a dso and then connecting to a daemon

is viable.

Note: qa/147 tests out doing a daemon and then a dso



Method:

1. use dbpmda with the sampledso and sample daemon with appropriate
